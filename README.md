# DNAToProtien-

## Discription
The code takes the coding strand and transforms it into the template strand to which is used as a template to make an RNA copy of coding strand of DNA.
the code then takes the amino acid sequence which is made up of codons which are 3 amino acids in a row and translates them into proteins. each codon 
sequence codes for a different protein or function. and finally, the code replies because with the short formed version of the proteins that would be 
made with whatever coding strand of DNA was inserted into the program.
