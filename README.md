# DNAToProtien

## Description

The application takes a DNA strand and breaks it down into sections of three. Using the thee long strands it transforms it into the template strands, It then uses the template to make an RNA copy of the DNA strand. The application then takes the amino acid sequence which is made up of codons which are 3 amino acids in a row and translates them into proteins. Each codon sequence codes for a different protein or function. Finally, the application repeats this process with all the subsections of the DNA till the DNA strands are transformed into Protiens, then if outputs the final protien strand.
